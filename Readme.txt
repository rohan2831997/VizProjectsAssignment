Thank You for this opportunity to present my work.

1. The 4 points of the rectangle are inputs from the text file- input.txt

2. In the main function there are 2 variables, x_p & y_p which has the point.(which we have to determine if it is inside or outside the rectangle)

3. Result - 0 -> out of the rectangle
	    1 -> Inside the rectangle
